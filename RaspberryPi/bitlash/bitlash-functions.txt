==NOTE: Syntax of this file
= This file will be machine read.
= Comments must be on a a line by themselves AND
= comment lines must start with '='.


==Monitoring functions==
= wl: Water Level (in mm, reversed. Actually distance to water from sensor above surface. Sensor located ~26cm above tank bottom)
= ll: Light Level (in a value 0-1023)
= wt: Water Temperature (in degrees C * 1000) NOTE: Slow function, ~1s per reading
= pc: Pump Current (in mA)
= at: Air Temperature (in degrees C * 1000)
= ap: Air Pressure (in mBar at sea level)
= alt: Altitued (in meters above sea level)

==Logging functions==
function pwl {printf("wl:%d\n", wl);};
function pll {printf("ll:%d\n", ar(0));};
function pwt {printf("wt:%d\n", wt);};
function ppc {printf("pc:%d\n", pc);};
function pat {printf("at:%d\n", at);};
function pap {printf("ap:%d\n", ap);};
function palt {printf("alt:%d\n", alt);};

==Heartbeat==
function hb {printf("hb:%d\n", millis);};

==Boot function, starting all logging automatically at power on==
function startup {run hb,10000;run pwl,2000;run pll,60000;run pwt,60000;run ppc,250;run pat,30000;run pap,60000;};


==Pump control functions==
rp: Run Pump
sp: Stop Pump
tp: Toggle Pump

==Examples==
run pwl,2000
run pll,2000
run pwt,2000
